Refactoring Notes
- Built base vehicle class which contains all necessary logic that pertains to a vehicle

- Left in specific properties for *Vehicle*Running in each subclass which references a protected property from the base vehicle class as to not change the original properties from the given classes
	however making the VehicleRunning property public and removing these would probably make more sense (could be less readable however)

- Base class takes in max passengers for a given vehicle

- Generic method within AddPassengersToVehicleController which adds empty people to a vehicle of the given type when that endpoint is called.



Problems with the API

- Seperate endpoints required for adding passengers to seperate vehicles rather than one which can interpret the vehicle the passengers would be added to

- HttpGet used when it seems as if post/put would be more relevent as something is being added or updated.

- No real output i.e. database behind the api.

- No feedback to the user other than OK.

- While authorization is added to the web app the attributes are not used in the controller
